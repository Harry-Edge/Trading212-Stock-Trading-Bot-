# Trading 212 Bit
This is a rudimentary stock trading robot that uses selenium and python. This program will automatically find stock prices and trade the given stock depending on certain conditions that are set/amended if you change the code.

This uses the demo version of the Trading212 platform. Due to the nature of websites changing and Trading212 not having an official API this stock trading robot is likely not to function if any HTML code is altered in any way. Use the code as an idea of how you could implement a more sophisticated bot, rather than as it presents itself.
